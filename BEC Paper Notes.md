### Abstract
Connects atomic superfluid rotation and cavity opto-mechanics.
Item of study is an annular BEC (0 viscosity).
	Item is also standard for Rotational Quantum Physics.
The cavity of use is an optomechanical field excitation carrying orbital angular momentum.
This paper wants to measure what has previously been destructive.
	This is also in real-time.
It also shows "light can actively manipulate rotating matter waves by optomechanically entangling persistent currents."


### Introduction
Persistent currents : Matter current that doesn't decay.
	Annular is highly controllable in labs for study.

List of connected phenomena (quantum circulation):
 - Phase slips
 - hysteresis
 - shock waves
 - matter-wave interferometry
 - gyroscopy
 - atomtronic circuits
 - Josephson physics
 - time crystals
 - topological excitations
 - cosmological simulations 
All rely on BEC contained in a ring.

Angular momentum of a BEC is encoded in a rotational eigenstate with phase.
	Appears in the form of the winding number.
This is not about fluid density, that remains uniform.

As of present, all measurements of BEC winding number have been destructive.
Minimal Destructive detection or far-off-resonance light, are only sensitive to density.
	Inference of BEC angular momentum relies on vortex precession.

Annularly trapped BEC does not precess, with the core pinned at the ring center.
	Measurement techniques above fail to measure without destruction or none at all.
	While possible to measure with off-resonance, entanglement still requires destruction.

The paper seeks to exploit cavity optomechanics to measure things previous unachievable.
	Sensing motion based on interactions with EM fields confined to a optical resonator.










### Questions

**Abstract**
It talks about "inside a cavity excited by optical fields carrying orbital angular momentum."
Does that mean orbital as in electron orbital, or an "orbits" angular momentum?
Does the ring of BEC rotating physically, or just the wavefunction?

It mentions "non-dispersive liquid" but mentions later that some of it can quantum tunnel.
What is the difference in definition that I'm missing?

How does an optomechanical field work? How is the BEC trapped from a physical perspective?


**Introduction**
What is a phase slip?
What is Josephson Physics?
What does it mean by topological excitations?

What is the relationship between phase and winding number?
What is an optical resonator?
How is our method of reflecting EM waves different than off-resonance measurements?

To make sure I understand, all previous methods have either been destructive, or incapable of measuring things that would be important to measure of an annular BEC?

BEC confined in a toroidal trap located at the center of an optical cavity.
$$U(\rho,z)=\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega_\rho\left(\rho-R\right)^2+\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega_zz^2$$
$\omega_\rho$ : Harmonic trapping frequency in the radial direction.
$\omega_z$ : Harmonic trapping frequency in the axial direction.
$R$  : Radius of the ring trap.
> This is the potential *per particle*.
> Energy is independent of the radial angle.
> Energy is decoupled between radial and axial directions.

A superposition of $\pm l\hbar$ photons are injected into the cavity to probe the BEC.
The energy of the photons are significantly away from ground-to-excited states of atomic transition.
The interaction between the photons and the atoms are via the dipole force.
Spontaneous photon scattering is assumed to be negligible.
Photon decay from the cavity will be accounted for.

We assume all atoms in the ring are in the same quantum state in the radial and axial.
We're focusing on the azimuth motion.
This one-dimensional description is reasonable for experimentation.












where $N$ and $a_\mathrm{Na}$ are the number and ground state scattering
length of the sodium atoms in the condensate, respectively.
A superposition of two frequency-degenerate optical
beams derived from the same laser and carrying orbital
angular momentum (OAM) lħ is now injected into the
cavity to probe the BEC. Such coherent superpositions

have been experimentally demonstrated to create an angu-
lar lattice inside the cavity about its axis [38]. The beams

are blue detuned far from the ground-to-excited state
atomic transition and therefore interact weakly with the
atoms via the dipole force, with the effect of spontaneous
photon scattering being negligible. Photon decay from the
cavity will be accounted for below.
The azimuthal motion of the BEC is described, in the

frame rotating at the laser drive frequency, by the one-
dimensional Hamiltonian [39,48–50]
