Random Walks, Brownian Motion, Percolation, and Active Matter

### Recap: Random Walk
 - Equally likely (uniform) step-direction distribution.
 - No net drift of the graph.
 - Each step is independent of the previous step.

### Brownian Motion
Obeys the heat/diffusion equation.
$D = \mu k_B T, \ \ \ \langle\Delta x\rangle = 2D\Delta\tau$
Where $\Delta\tau$ is lag time.

### Fractals
Fractal Dimension: Scale of Areas to Lengths.
If a fractal is 3x area per 2x length, then the dimension is $\log_2\left(3\right)$.
