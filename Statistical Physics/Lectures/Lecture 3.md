### Random Walk
Process by which randomly-moving objects wander away from where they started.
Mean Distance: $\langle s\rangle = 0$
RMS Distance: $\langle s^2\rangle = NL^2 \implies s_\mathrm{RMS} = L\sqrt{N}$
#### Example: DNA
If the bending length of DNA is $50\mathrm{nm}$, with $0.34\mathrm{nm}$ per nucleotide pair, what is the RMS distance between the ends of a gene with $100,000$ base pairs.
$$s_\mathrm{RMS} = 0.34\mathrm{nm}\sqrt{100,000} \approx 1300\mathrm{nm} = 26\ \mathrm{Bending\ Lengths}$$
