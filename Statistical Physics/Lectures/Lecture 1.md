Statistical Physics provides a link between microscale (fundamental) properties and macroscale (emergent) properties.
#### Core Principles
1. The laws of physics have to be maintained. Energy must be conserved.
2. Systems tend to evolve toward more likely states (maximize entropy).
$$S = k_b \log \Omega$$
### Laws of Thermodynamics
0th  Law: Concept of Temperature
1st  Law: Energy Conservation
2nd Law: Concept of Entropy
3rd  Law: Absolute Zero Temperature
