### Symmetries and Applications
Invariance under a group of transformations.

**Angular momentum**
Consider $L=x\times p = mx\times\dot{x}$
$$\dfrac{dL}{dt}= m\dot{x}\times\dot{x} + mx\times\ddot{x}$$
For a spherically-symmetric potential about the origin, then $\dfrac{dL}{dt}=0$

| Symmetry             | Conservation Law               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Translation in Space | Linear Momentum                |
| Translation in Time  | Energy                         |
| Rotational Symmetry  | Angular Momentum               |
| Gauge Symmetry       | Electric, Weak, Strong Charges |
Structure is related to lower symmetry.


What is an order parameter?
It's the contest of energy and entropy.
At low temperature, energy/order wins.
At high temperatures, entropy/disorder wins.

The order parameter is a macroscopic quantity that changes drastically with temperature change.
It doesn't have to be temperature, it's just the most common. Magnetic field is also another.

First-order phase transitions are discontinuous.
Second-order phase transitions are continuous.



Increasing symmetry requires energy.
Decreasing symmetry releases energy.
