### Ising Model
The 3D proof still doesn't exist, but 2D and 1D both do.

$\mathcal{H} = -\displaystyle\sum_{i,j} J s_is_j - H\displaystyle\sum_i s_i$     $Z = \displaystyle\sum e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}}$

For adjacent parallel spins $-J$ and adjacent antiparallel spins $+J$.
For $J>0$, the interaction is ferromagnetic with parallel spin, at typically low temperatures.
For $J<0$, the interaction is antiferromagnetic with an alternating pattern of spins.
> I'd be interested mathematically between all 1s/0s or even mixing of the D-J Algorithm.

At high temperatures, the entropy leads to a paramagnetic phase where spin fluctuates.

$m=\dfrac{M}{N}=\dfrac{\sum_i s_i}{N}$     $\langle m\rangle = 0$

If there is 2 very different states between the 2 temperatures, there's a temperature that transition occurs.

Average Magnetization : $m = \langle s(i,j)\rangle$
Variance Magnetization : $\sigma^2=\langle s^2(i,j)\rangle-\langle s(i,j)\rangle^2$
Correlation Function      : $\chi(r-r')=\langle s(r)s(r)'\rangle-\langle s(r)\rangle \langle s(r)'\rangle$
Magnetic Susceptibility : $\chi_0=\dfrac{\partial \langle M\rangle}{\partial H}$

#### First-Order Transition
Discontinuous jump in $M$ occurs as $H$ pass through 0 for $T<T_c$.




### Lecture 21

$\mathcal{H} = -\displaystyle\sum_{i,j} J s_is_j - H\displaystyle\sum_i s_i$     $Z = \displaystyle\sum e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}}$

$$\langle M\rangle=-\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial H}$$
$$\chi_0=\dfrac{\partial \langle M\rangle}{\partial H}=-\dfrac{\partial^2 F}{\partial H^2}$$
